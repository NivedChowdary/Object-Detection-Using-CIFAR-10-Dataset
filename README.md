# object-detection-using-CIFAR-10-Dataset
CIFAR dataset is the official dataset of tensorflow with having 60000 images in it for more info click on this link  https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html and in this project we train 50000 images and test 10000 images
In this code i had split the data as 50000 for training and 10000 for testing and i have used very basic algorithm that is CNN(Convolution Nural Network)
For detailed explanation on CNN you can refer this site https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/convolutional-neural-networks-python?utm_source=adwords_ppc&utm_campaignid=1455363063&utm_adgroupid=65083631748&utm_device=c&utm_keyword=&utm_matchtype=b&utm_network=g&utm_adpostion=1t1&utm_creative=332602034358&utm_targetid=aud-299261629574:dsa-473406581915&utm_loc_interest_ms=&utm_loc_physical_ms=1007740&gclid=CjwKCAjw04vpBRB3EiwA0Iieas7gToq0j3EmlOKNesgUsjvtzQEtlejdjfhhzAGT-mAiOiKEglGkEhoCOq8QAvD_BwE

For more examples on CNN you can refer this Document    https://keras.io/search.html?q=cnn 
lets get into the code open the document code.
when it comes to accuracy it all depends upon your computational power.
